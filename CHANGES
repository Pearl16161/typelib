== Version 1.0rc2
* added a limited CORBA IDL export plugin
* namespace support in the C importer. In the meantime, fixed
  the (badly broken) namespace support of Typelib::Registry
* added a "cxx" mode to the C importer (enabled by default), 
  where definitions of "struct Bla" and "enum Blo" automatically
  define the corresponding "Bla" and "Blo" types

== Version 0.3
=== API
* new functionalities:
  - EndianSwapVisitor: endianness swapping
  - Registry#merge: merging one registry in another (taking care of
    duplicates)
  - export a (still minimal) public API for the Ruby extension
* bugfixes. Among them:
  - Fixed multiple problems with array handling. In particular,
    multi-dimensional arrays now work fine.
  - fixed Float -> double* and Float -> float* convertions in function
    calls

=== Ruby
* new functionalities:
  - Typelib::memcpy
  - Type#to_byte_array, Type#initialize: use of String objects as buffers.
    This allows to interact with #pack or I/O

  - Type#to_csv and Type::to_csv: CSV output

* bugfixes. Among them:
  - handle array arguments in functions
  - fix Type#== for types that do double-dispatch
