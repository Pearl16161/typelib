== Installing Typelib ==

Note for Debian users: a quick install guide is included at the
bottom of this file

=== C++ library
The C++ library depends on the following:
 * the boost library, including boost/filesystem
 * utilmm which can be downloaded using Darcs with
     darcs get http://www.laas.fr/~sjoyeux/darcs/utilmm
   (check the INSTALL file)
 * the antlr parser generator
 * cmake and pkg-config
 * doxygen for the documentation (optional)
 * libxml2

When all these dependencies are installed, run
    cmake .
    make

and as root,
    make install

=== Ruby bindings
The installation of the Ruby bindings require the following:
 * the ruby interpreter version 1.8 and the associated
   development files.
   Under Debian, these are named ruby1.8 and libruby1.8-dev
 * testrb for the test suite
 * rdoc for generating the documentation (optional)

At runtime, the bindings require the following:
 * utilrb, which is best downloaded as a gem. See
     http://www.rubygems.org for information about the RubyGems
     system. This system can be installed by the rubygems
     package on Debian.
 
   When you have installed rubygems, run
     gem install utilrb

   You may have to run it as root if RubyGems is installed
   globally (this is the case for Debian's rubygems package)

   You can also find the sources at
     darcs get http://www.laas.fr/~sjoyeux/darcs/utilrb
   read the INSTALL.txt file

=== Quick Debian installation guide

Run as root
  apt-get install libboost-dev libboost-filesystem-dev antlr autoconf automake ruby1.8-dev libtest-unit-ruby rubygems cantlr libantlr-dev pkg-config doxygen rdoc1.8 libxml2-dev
  gem install utilrb

Run as a normal user
  <go into a source directory>
  darcs get http://www.laas.fr/~sjoyeux/darcs/utilmm
  <install the utilmm library by following instructions in
  utilmm/INSTALL>

  <go into Typelib source directory>
  ./autogen.sh
